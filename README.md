# Rutgers-Charity-Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to utilize and optimize a neural network with tensorflow in Python.
 
The work thus far is outlined in Python code and the involves preprocessing the data
and the initial fit of the neural network. The next stage is to optimize the model
by changing the number of neurons in each layer, the number of layers, or the optimization function.
